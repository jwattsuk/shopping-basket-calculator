# shopping-basket-calculator

A simple java program to calculate the price of a shopping basket. 
The items in the basket contain multiple occurrences of the same item presented one by one. 
Items have specific prices that may change. 
Items can also have temporary offers on them which can expire in future. 

* Apples are 35p. 
* Bananas are 20p. 
* Melons are 50p and offer on melons is — buy 1 get 1. 
* Limes are 15p and offer on limes are — buy 3 for price of 2. 

The shopping basket can have a maximum 100 items. 

We need to add new items, new prices and new offers in the easiest way possible in future.
